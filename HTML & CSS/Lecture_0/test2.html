        King Mindon established <small> a new royal capital </small> surrounded by 4 rivers at the foot of <em> Mandalay Hill in February 1857.</em> The construction was intended to fulfil a prophecy in which a Buddhism metropolis was to be built at the exact location where <small></small> the 2,400th jubilee of Buddhism </small> took place. The city grew as a strong capital city for <i> 26 years </i> before being conquered by the British Empire, establishing the Mandalay we see today as the last royal capital city of the Konbaung Dynasty. Mandalay city was heavily affected by the Second World War but the royal mint and watch tower survived the damages.
