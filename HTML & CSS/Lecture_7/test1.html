        In publishing and graphic design, Lorem ipsum is a placeholder text commonly used to demonstrate the visual form of a document 
        or a typeface without relying on meaningful content. Lorem ipsum may be used as a placeholder before final copy is available. 
        It is also used to temporarily replace text in a process called greeking, which allows designers to consider the form of a webpage 
        or publication, without the meaning of the text influencing the design.
